/**
 * <pre>
 * NoticeResponse (B) 
 * Byte1('N') Identifies the message as a notice. 
 * Int32 Length of message contents in bytes, including self. The message 
 *       body consists of one or more identified fields, followed by a zero 
 *       byte as a terminator. Fields can appear in any order. For each 
 *       field there is the following: 
 * Byte1 A code identifying the field type; if zero, this is the message 
 *       terminator and no string follows. The presently defined field types 
 *       are listed in Section 46.6. Since more field types might be added
 *       in future, frontends should silently ignore fields of unrecognized 
 *       type.
 * String The field value.
