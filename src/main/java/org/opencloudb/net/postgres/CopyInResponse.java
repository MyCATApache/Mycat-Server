 * CopyInResponse (B)     
 * Byte1('G') Identifies the message as a Start Copy In response. 
 *            The frontend must now send copy-in data (if not prepared 
 *            to do so, send a CopyFail message).
 * Int32 Length of message contents in bytes, including self.
 * Int8 0 indicates the overall COPY format is textual (rows separated 
 *      by newlines, columns separated by separator characters, etc). 
 *      1 indicates the overall copy format is binary (similar to DataRow 
 *      format). See COPY for more information.
 * Int16 The number of columns in the data to be copied (denoted N below).
 * Int16[N] The format codes to be used for each column. Each must presently 
 *          be zero (text) or one (binary). All must be zero if the overall 
 *          copy format is textual.
